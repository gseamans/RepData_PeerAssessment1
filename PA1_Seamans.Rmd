## Loading and preprocessing the data
The data used for this project can be downloaded from 
[Activity Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip)

The data contains a header row. There are three columns: *steps*, *date*, *interval*.

1. **steps**: Number of steps taken in a 5-minute interval. Missing values are encoded as
NA.
2. **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
3. **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.
```
activities <- read.csv(file = "data/activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
